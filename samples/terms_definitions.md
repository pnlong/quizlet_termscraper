HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The headright system and indentured servants are interrelated, as the headright system allowed indentured servants to work off their debts and ultimately become like any other settlers with land and prospects. The headright system also brought laborers -who brought their families and servants-, some of which would put together some prominent manors and settlements in the future. The indentured servants who helped populate the colonies also helped boost Virginia&#039;s economy by growing and selling tobacco, Virginia&#039;s number one crop at the time. These servants were the harbingers of future Virginia colonists.

    - *James Oglethorpe*: Founder and governor of the Georgia colony. He ran a tightly-disciplined, military-like colony. Slaves, alcohol, and Catholicism were forbidden in his colony. Many colonists felt that Oglethorpe was a dictator, and that (along with the colonist's dissatisfaction over not being allowed to own slaves) caused the colony to break down and Oglethorpe to lose his position as governor.
    - *James Oglethorpe/Georgia*: founder of a colony set up as a buffer bet/ Spanish Florida and the Carolinas; Oglethorpe wanted to use Georgia as a haven/fresh start for English debtors and he outlawed slavery in the colony, a policy that did not last; he also led the sporadic border wars against Spain during the War of Austrian Succession, 1740-48 (also King George's War)
    - *(38.) James Oglethorpe*: ID: James Oglethorpe was a member of the English Parliament and a previous war hero, who came to the New World to found the colony of Georgia in 1733, to which he became governor. Oglethorpe and his trustees had mostly military and philanthropic motives for founding Georgia, such as building a military barrier against the Spanish settlements to deal with border disputes and providing a new life for the impoverished from England as well as a refuge for the individuals imprisoned for debt in England as well. Significance: Oglethorpe's image of Georgia failed to become a reality, as his policies were too harsh for the settlers to comply with. Size of landholdings was small, as he wished the colony to be compact and easier to defend from the Spanish and natives. Oglethorpe feared slave labor due to its potential to cause internal revolt. Rum was outlawed for its potential of abuse, trade was strictly regulated with natives, and all Catholics were forbidden to settle in Georgia for fear of the possible association with the Catholic Spanish. Oglethorpe demonstrated the plight of a strictly regulated settlement, in which opposition to near absolute rule called for major reform in social and political areas. This call justified the power of influence for the settlers to change their government, as Oglethorpe eventually became disillusioned by military loss and failure of economic growth in Georgia. As the colony was given over to royal control in 1751, permission to establish a representative assembly was granted.

    - *(38.) James Oglethorpe*: ID: James Oglethorpe was a member of the English Parliament and a previous war hero, who came to the New World to found the colony of Georgia in 1733, to which he became governor. Oglethorpe and his trustees had mostly military and philanthropic motives for founding Georgia, such as building a military barrier against the Spanish settlements to deal with border disputes and providing a new life for the impoverished from England as well as a refuge for the individuals imprisoned for debt in England as well. Significance: Oglethorpe's image of Georgia failed to become a reality, as his policies were too harsh for the settlers to comply with. Size of landholdings was small, as he wished the colony to be compact and easier to defend from the Spanish and natives. Oglethorpe feared slave labor due to its potential to cause internal revolt. Rum was outlawed for its potential of abuse, trade was strictly regulated with natives, and all Catholics were forbidden to settle in Georgia for fear of the possible association with the Catholic Spanish. Oglethorpe demonstrated the plight of a strictly regulated settlement, in which opposition to near absolute rule called for major reform in social and political areas. This call justified the power of influence for the settlers to change their government, as Oglethorpe eventually became disillusioned by military loss and failure of economic growth in Georgia. As the colony was given over to royal control in 1751, permission to establish a representative assembly was granted.

    - *(37.) John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians)*: 37.) John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians) ID: John Smith (an Englishman) was a famous world traveler and council president in Jamestown Pocahontas (an Indian) was the daughter of the great chief, Powhatan Smith was purportedly saved by Pocahontas (who was 11 years old) when the chief ordered him clubbed to death after being captured by the Indians and wouldn't allow her father to kill him This occurred in the Indian area of Werowocomoco Smith was spared and Pocahontas, years later, ended up marrying John Rolfe Pocahontas helped preserve Jamestown and ensured that it didn't disappear like Roanoke HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: John Smith's encounter with Powhatan as well as Pocahontas showed him different things about the Indians as well as saved the extinction of a colony. First of all, Powhatan was ready to murder John Smith and thus his character would have seemed to be reckless and savage. On the other hand, when Pocahontas saved Smith, she exhibited no savageness but instead sympathy and equality. Thus maybe Smith's outlook on Indians may have changed and may have no longer considered all natives as savages. After this, Pocahontas visited the colonies, bringing food. She even became the liaison (contact or connection maintained by communications) between settlers and Indians, elevating Smith's importance among the feuding colonists. #37

    - *(37.) John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians)*: 37.) John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians) ID: John Smith (an Englishman) was a famous world traveler and council president in Jamestown Pocahontas (an Indian) was the daughter of the great chief, Powhatan Smith was purportedly saved by Pocahontas (who was 11 years old) when the chief ordered him clubbed to death after being captured by the Indians and wouldn't allow her father to kill him This occurred in the Indian area of Werowocomoco Smith was spared and Pocahontas, years later, ended up marrying John Rolfe Pocahontas helped preserve Jamestown and ensured that it didn't disappear like Roanoke HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: John Smith's encounter with Powhatan as well as Pocahontas showed him different things about the Indians as well as saved the extinction of a colony. First of all, Powhatan was ready to murder John Smith and thus his character would have seemed to be reckless and savage. On the other hand, when Pocahontas saved Smith, she exhibited no savageness but instead sympathy and equality. Thus maybe Smith's outlook on Indians may have changed and may have no longer considered all natives as savages. After this, Pocahontas visited the colonies, bringing food. She even became the liaison (contact or connection maintained by communications) between settlers and Indians, elevating Smith's importance among the feuding colonists. #37

John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians) ID: John Smith (an Englishman) was a famous world traveler and council president in Jamestown Pocahontas (an Indian) was the daughter of the great chief, Powhatan Smith was purportedly saved by Pocahontas (who was 11 years old) when the chief ordered him clubbed to death after being captured by the Indians and wouldn't allow her father to kill him This occurred in the Indian area of Werowocomoco Smith was spared and Pocahontas, years later, ended up marrying John Rolfe Pocahontas helped preserve Jamestown and ensured that it didn't disappear like Roanoke HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: John Smith's encounter with Powhatan as well as Pocahontas showed him different things about the Indians as well as saved the extinction of a colony. First of all, Powhatan was ready to murder John Smith and thus his character would have seemed to be reckless and savage. On the other hand, when Pocahontas saved Smith, she exhibited no savageness but instead sympathy and equality. Thus maybe Smith's outlook on Indians may have changed and may have no longer considered all natives as savages. After this, Pocahontas visited the colonies, bringing food. She even became the liaison (contact or connection maintained by communications) between settlers and Indians, elevating Smith's importance among the feuding colonists. #37

John Smith + Pocahontas (Powhatan Indians) ID: John Smith (an Englishman) was a famous world traveler and council president in Jamestown Pocahontas (an Indian) was the daughter of the great chief, Powhatan Smith was purportedly saved by Pocahontas (who was 11 years old) when the chief ordered him clubbed to death after being captured by the Indians and wouldn't allow her father to kill him This occurred in the Indian area of Werowocomoco Smith was spared and Pocahontas, years later, ended up marrying John Rolfe Pocahontas helped preserve Jamestown and ensured that it didn't disappear like Roanoke HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: John Smith's encounter with Powhatan as well as Pocahontas showed him different things about the Indians as well as saved the extinction of a colony. First of all, Powhatan was ready to murder John Smith and thus his character would have seemed to be reckless and savage. On the other hand, when Pocahontas saved Smith, she exhibited no savageness but instead sympathy and equality. Thus maybe Smith's outlook on Indians may have changed and may have no longer considered all natives as savages. After this, Pocahontas visited the colonies, bringing food. She even became the liaison (contact or connection maintained by communications) between settlers and Indians, elevating Smith's importance among the feuding colonists. #37

The result would be an example for all the world and would particularly inspire England to live up to its role as God's "elect nation".
    - *Transatlantic Slave Trade*: The Transatlantic Slave trade lasted from the 16th to the 19th century. Millions of Africans were forced to leave their homes and be transported to the British, Portuguese, French, Spanish, and Dutch empires in the Americas. It is estimated that around 9-11 million people were traded. These slaves were transported on ships that provided very harsh conditions, and many people died in just the journey alone. The first step in the process of the Slave Trade was when ships left from Europe with loaded goods. Next, these goods were sent to Africa in exchange for slaves. These slaves were then transported to wherever they were needed. (Mary Kate)

Many of them turned to the New World for their financial purposes and individual wealth.
    - *Primogeniture*: A system of inheritance in which the eldest son recieved all of the father's inheritance, leaving the other sons with nothing. These younger sons were brought over to america as indentured servants, making up a portion of the early colonial population. Primogeniture was not practiced in America, and fathers split up all the land between the sons. Yet as the land was subdivided throughout the generations, sons got less and less land, and towns got more crowded. As a result, new towns were started by the youth that was crowded out.

    - *(36.)Primogeniture*: ID: Primogeniture is by law or custom, of the first-born son to inherit everything after the father passes away. The second born son as a result, received nothing. The custom took place in England among families and even in almost all of the 13 original colonies. Historical Significance: The control of the inheritance allowed a father to exercise power over the male members of his family. In countries such as England, there was a primogeniture surplus and as a result there was an incentive for many individuals to move and colonize in North America. Primogeniture can create a class of poor individuals who want to seek fortune elsewhere.

The public's response to fight the English Civil War in 1642 illustrates the power of the Puritans, who were the main supporters of the Parliament. Because the Roundheads (supporters of the Parliament) were able to defeat the supporters of the king in 1649, the public was able to exonerate themselves from Charles I's absolute rule. After Charles I was beheaded, Oliver Cromwell took over as the Lord Protector. Eventually, the throne was restored into Charles II's hands (the son of Charles I). The Restoration granted the English the ability to colonize once again.
